        <p>Something excited happened. I made my first HTML CSS blog. I'm want to start a youtube channel, maybe I'll start filming today after this project. I'll definitly post links here if I do.</p>

            Hello again, back again with my second post. I'm going to make this a bit longer so I can really see the page scroll when I click the internal links. Haven't started filming yet, but I know what I want to make videos on. In addition to my progress learning programming, I want to discuss games, gear reviews, stock market data, cryptocurrency prices, and digital minimalism.
